GifTastic for HW6

Using HTML, CSS, and jQuery JavaScript, make an animal GIF page. Use an AJAX call to the GIPHY API.

Dynamically generate buttons that will call the GIPHY API and return several GIFs for that animal (or other search string). Dynamically place these on the page in stills. When the images are clicked, they switch between animated and still. When a new search is performed, the old images are replaced.

Let the user add their own animals (or other search string) using a form that does not reload the page.
